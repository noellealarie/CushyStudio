3. Type-safe experience pushed to the MAXIMUM
    1. Every single value/enum is typed
    2. A built-in standard library made to quickly build your dream workflow
    3. Use lambda to get completion only for the node that produces the value needed

# Quickstart Guide For Action Creators

***üõãÔ∏è CushyStudio*** comes packed with features to allow you to create your own AI-powered image and video creation tools.

In Cushy, tools are called `Actions`.

Creating actions is easy because `üõãÔ∏è CushyStudio`

1. On startup, ensure ***CushyStudio*** is connected to some ***ComfyUI*** server

    - A whole ***TypeScript Action SDK*** will be generated in the `schema/` folder
    - All your custom nodes, models, and images will be converted to `enums`, `classes`, `helpers`, etc, allowing you to create actions with maximum type safety and completion.

1. Create a folder in the `actions/` subfolder at the root
1. Create any `myaction.ts` file inside this folder
1. Open the whole ***CushyStudio*** repository in ***Visual Studio Code***

    - üëâ Open the whole CushyStudio installed repository
    - NOT just the action folder, NOR the action file itself, but:

1. Initialize your action from some basic code or generated code from existing workflows

    ```ts
    action('demo1-basic', {
        author: 'rvion',
        // A. define the UI
        ui: (form) => ({
            positive: form.str({ label: 'Positive', default: 'flower' }),
        }),
        // B. defined the execution logic
        run: async (action, form) => {
            //  build a ComfyUI graph
            const graph = action.nodes
            const ckpt = graph.CheckpointLoaderSimple({ ckpt_name: 'albedobaseXL_v02.safetensors' })
            const seed = action.randomSeed()
            const sampler = graph.KSampler({
                seed: seed,
                steps: 20,
                cfg: 14,
                sampler_name: 'euler',
                scheduler: 'normal',
                denoise: 0.8,
                model: ckpt,
                positive: graph.CLIPTextEncode({ text: form.positive, clip: ckpt }),
                negative: graph.CLIPTextEncode({ text: '', clip: ckpt }),
                latent_image: graph.EmptyLatentImage({ width: 512, height: 512, batch_size: 1 }),
            })

            graph.SaveImage({
                images: graph.VAEDecode({ samples: sampler, vae: ckpt }),
                filename_prefix: 'ComfyUI',
            })

            // run the graph you built
            await action.PROMPT()
        },
    })
    ```

1. See how actions look like by dropping any ***ComfyUI*** `workflow` or `image` into the action and looking at the `converted.ts`

An Action is a file containing

-   An UI definition (widgets, form, styles, default values, tabs, etc...) (a bit like Gradio in Python)
-   A piece of code that runs your action
-   ...And more

## Publish your Action pack

Publishing your action is easy!

1.  Create a GitHub repository. (https://github.com/new)

    ![](docs/static/img/screenshots/2023-10-18-23-15-11.png)

2.  Commit your actions files (follow instructions given by Git Hub on the new repository page).

3.  Open an issue asking to add your `action pack` to the `marketplace`.
